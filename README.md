### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a highly motivated and passionate student with expertise in machine learning, data structures and algorithms, and web development, I am always seeking opportunities to apply my skills and learn from experienced professionals in the industry.

My strong technical foundation in ML and DSA has given me a deep understanding of the core concepts and practical applications in these fields. Additionally, my proficiency in web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React has enabled me to build engaging and responsive web applications.

Whether it's collaborating on a new project, learning from experienced mentors, or contributing to a team, I am always looking for ways to grow my skills and knowledge. If you are interested in connecting and exploring opportunities in the tech industry, please feel free to reach out!
